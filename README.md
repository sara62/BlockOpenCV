# BlockOpenCV
=====================

This is the OpenCV CinderBlock, designed for use with the open-source C++ library Cinder: http://libcinder.org

Integrates OpenCV 2.4.2

# Support :
----------------


* These projects are meant to run on Mountain Lion OSX with xcode version 4.5 

* Support for anything less please see the [ older OpenCV Block ] (https://github.com/cinder/Cinder-OpenCV)


# Mac Installation : 
--------------------

- open up terminal

- navigate to your cinder blocks folder (i.e. UserName$ cd /Developer/Cinder/blocks)

- do a git clone of the repo using the command :

`````
sudo git clone https://github.com/kod3000/BlockOpenCV.git opencv2.4.2

`````

- using xcode open up an example and start building!



### Note - You'll need to have the cinder library compiled at 64bit in order to run the example files. [ You can get the working copy that I use ] (https://github.com/kod3000/Cinder/tree/dany) with all the needed support already done for you.



----------------------



### If you're running on Windows 64bit and know your way around compiling static libraries please contribute to this block. Thanks!

 Lots of thanks to the core cinder team. Without them none of this would be possible. Cinder 0.8.5 + OpenCV 2.4.2 = â™¥
