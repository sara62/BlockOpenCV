# BlockOpenCV

This is the OpenCV CinderBlock, designed for use with the open-source C++ library Cinder: http://libcinder.org

Integrates OpenCV 2.4.2


* These projects are meant to run on Mountain Lion OSX with xcode version 4.5 

* Support for anything less please see the [ older OpenCV Block ] (https://github.com/cinder/Cinder-OpenCV)


# Mac Installation : 

- open up terminal
- navigate to your cinder blocks folder (i.e. UserName$ cd /Developer/Cinder/blocks)
- do a git clone of the repo using the command :

`````
sudo git clone https://github.com/kod3000/BlockOpenCV.git opencv2.4.2

`````

- Open up an example using xcode and start building!

Note - You'll need the cinder library to be compiled at 64bit in order to run the example files. [ You can get the working copy that I use ] (https://github.com/kod3000/Cinder) with all the needed support.


### If you're running on Windows 64bit and know your way around compiling static libraries please contribute to this block. Thanks!
