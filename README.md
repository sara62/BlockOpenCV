# BlockOpenCV

This is the OpenCV CinderBlock, designed for use with the open-source C++ library Cinder: http://libcinder.org

Integrates OpenCV 2.4.2


* These projects are meant to run on Mountain Lion OSX with xcode version 4.5 *

* Support for Anything less please see the Older OpenCV Block *


# Installation : 

- open up terminal
- navigate to the cinder blocks folder (i.e. UserName$ cd /Developer/Cinder/blocks)
- do a git clone of the repo using the comman

'''
sudo git clone https://github.com/kod3000/BlockOpenCV.git opencv2.4.2

'''

Note - You'll need the cinder library to be compiled at 64bit in order to run the example files. You can get the working copy that I use with all the needed support.


### If you're running on Windows 64bit and know your way around compiling static libraries please contribute to this block. Thanks!
